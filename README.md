Prof. Luyao Zhang provided constructive comments on the feasibility of my research questions and data collection, which prompted me to continuously improve and enhance.
- **Project Summary**: In 2022, the global NFT market was dismal and a bear market in the crypto market arrived. In June, the global market traded for only $1.04 billion, down 74% MoM from the $4 billion traded in May, marking the largest drop in global NFT trading. ("Marketplaces Archives" 2023). On June 1, Nate Chastain, a former product manager at the world's largest NFT trading platform, OpenSea, was arrested by U.S. law enforcement authorities on charges of wire fraud and money laundering related to insider trading in NFT. (U.S. Attorney's Office 2022). This significant event reflects the widespread security vulnerabilities in the NFT trading market. The impact of NFT security events on the daily trading volume of Ethereum is the focus of this study. This study processes and analyzes the daily trading volume (in Ethereum) on OpenSea 2022 on Dune Analytic through a machine learning method of prediction. ("OpenSea Daily Volume (Ethereum) in ETH" 2023). The study found that the security breach hit the platform's trading volume, leading to a market downturn for at least the next two months. The research highlights the significant impact of long-standing security breaches on industry growth and contributes to the analysis of NFT's market direction. It also provides future directions for improvement and optimization in the crypto-sphere market. The criteria for NFT security attributes should be more accurately defined in the future.
